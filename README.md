# Assignment: Timetables

Eficode headquarters is located at [Pohjoinen Rautatiekatu 25](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pohjoinen+Rautatiekatu+25,+00100+Helsinki). Even while it is close to various public transportation options, people might still be easily late from work. And what's worst, our people might forget to leave early as they are working on something challenging or enjoying our rooftop sauna.

Your task is to help Eficodeans leave at the right time so that they would not miss any important, or why not less important, commitments.

## The task

Your task is to create an info screen, which displays the public transportation timetables between a location or a stop of your selection and Eficode headquarters. You can either display the schedules for the location someone would travel to the Eficode headquarters from, or then schedules from Eficode to the location of your selection.

### Mandatory

* Use the Helsinki Regional Transport (HSL) [open data interface](https://www.hsl.fi/en/opendata).
* Use [graphql](https://graphql.org/) as the query language.
* Publish your solution as a user interface in cloud of your selection so that it is accessible through a browser.
* Use [docker](https://docs.docker.com/) for packaging your application, even if you published it in some other way.

### Optional

* Write the solution using [React](https://reactjs.org/).
* Use a UI framework (e.g. [uikit](https://getuikit.com/)) and make the display pretty.
* Add user interface (e.g. [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)) and/or unit testing (e.g. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)).
* Add [eslint](http://eslint.org/).
* Add any funtionalities that do not disrupt the usability, but feel important to you.

## Returning your solution

* Publish the application into a cloud of your selection.
* Create a personal repository in [github](https://github.com) where you push your solution into.
* Send us the urls where to find the display and the code.
