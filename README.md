# Timetables App

Eficode headquarters are located at Pohjoinen Rautatiekatu 25. Even while it is close to various public transportations, people are still easily late from work. And what's worst, our people might forget to leave early as they are enjoying the sauna or working on something challenging at work.

Your task is to help Eficodeans leave at the right time so that nobody would miss any important, or why not less important, commitments.

## The task

Your task is to create an info screen, which displays the public transportation schedules between a location or a stop of your selection and Eficode headquarters. You can either display the schedules for the location people would travel to the Eficode headquarters from, or then schedules from Eficode to the location of your selection.

### Mandatory

* Use the Helsinki Regional Transport (HSL) [open data interface](https://www.hsl.fi/en/opendata) for your task.
* Use [graphql](https://graphql.org/) as the query language.
* Publish your solution as a user interface in cloud of your selection so that it is accessible through a browser.

### Optional

* Write the solution using [React](https://reactjs.org/).
* Use a UI framework (e.g. [uikit](https://getuikit.com/)).
* Use [docker](https://docs.docker.com/) for packing and publishing your application.
* Add user interface (e.g. [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)) and/or unit testing (e.g. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)).
* Add [eslint](http://eslint.org/) to your solution.
* Add documentation to your solution.

## Returning your solution

* Create a personal repository in [github](https://github.com) where you push your solution into.
* Send us the url where to find the code.
